Innovation is 
a new idea, 
more effective device or process
Innovation can be viewed as 
the application of better solutions 
that meet new requirements, 
unarticulated needs, 
or existing market needs.
This is accomplished through 
more effective products, 
processes, services, technologies, 
or ideas that are 
readily available to markets, 
governments and society. 
The term innovation 
can be defined as something original 
and more effective and, 
as a consequence, 
new, 
that "breaks into" the market 
or society

While a novel device 
is often described as an innovation, 
in economics, management science, 
and other fields of practice 
and analysis, 
innovation is generally considered 
to be a process that brings together 
various novel ideas in a way 
that they have an impact on society.
