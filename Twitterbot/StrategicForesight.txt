Strategic foresight is 
a planning-oriented subset of 
foresight (futurology, futures studies), 
the study of the future. 
Strategy is a high level plan 
to achieve one or more goals u
nder conditions of uncertainty. 
Strategic foresight happens 
when any planner uses scanned inputs, 
forecasts, alternative futures exploration, 
analysis and feedback to produce or alter plans 
and actions of the organization.

Strategic planning always includes analysis, 
but it may or may not involve serious foresight 
on the way to developing a plan, 
or taking an action. 
A consideration of possible futures 
(alternative futures) 
and of probable futures 
(forecasts, predictions) 
is important 
to developing a preferred future (plan), 
even the simple mental plans 
made prior to taking an action.
It is the job of the strategic foresight professional 
to make sure appropriately diverse 
and relevant inputs, forecasts, 
and alternatives are considered in the analysis, 
decisionmaking and planning processes, 
that plans are appropriately communicated 
and that when actions are taken, 
appropriate feedback occurs 
and after action reviews 
take place to improve 
the foresight process.

Strategic foresight is a 
growing practice in 
corporate foresight in 
large companies 
Its use is also growing in 
government and
non-profit organisations.
